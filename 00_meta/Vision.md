The Digital Grimoire exists to preserve understanding, not just information.

Understanding is fragile.
Tools change.
Languages die.
Mental models survive.

This project aims to:
- externalize thinking
- capture evolving mental models
- allow AI to extend (not replace) understanding
- become a personal operating system for knowledge
